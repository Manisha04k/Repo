Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems in 1995.

It follows the principle “Write Once, Run Anywhere”, thanks to the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

Java is widely used for web development, mobile apps (Android), enterprise software, and more.

It has strong memory management, security features, and supports multithreading.

Java's rich API, libraries, and large community make it ideal for beginners and professionals alike.
